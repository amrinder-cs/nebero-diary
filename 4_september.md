### Introduction to Deep Packet Inspection

Today I was looking at deep packet inspection (DPI) and explored the Netify deep packet inspection tool. My journey began with a general investigation into DPI techniques, which are fascinating because they allow for the analysis of data packets at a granular level. This capability is incredibly useful for network management, security, and monitoring, as it enables the identification of specific types of traffic and potential threats without significantly impacting performance. I found out about deep packet inspection from a [Mozilla blog](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/understand-encrypted-client-hello).

### Installing Netify

I decided to install the Netify agent on my system to see how it performs in a real-world scenario. The installation process was straightforward. For more details on the installation process, you can refer to the [Netify documentation](https://www.netify.ai/documentation/netify-agent/v5).

### Discovering Limitations

However, as I dug deeper, I discovered that not everything about Netify was ideal for our needs. While the tool boasts a sleek and user-friendly dashboard, I found that some of its plugins are closed source. This lack of transparency was a bit concerning, as it meant that we wouldn't have full control or visibility over all aspects of the tool. Additionally, using Netify would require sending data to their servers, which raised privacy and security concerns for our specific use case.

### Decision to Develop a Custom Plugin

Given these limitations, I realized that relying solely on Netify was not a viable option for us. The need for a more tailored solution became apparent, and we decided that developing our own plugin would be the best course of action. This approach would allow us to maintain full control over our data and ensure that our specific requirements are met without compromising on security or performance.
